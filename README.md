# AdventOfCode2024

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

Here you can find my solutions (and also failed attempts) for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) using Kotlin. I try to be as much idiomatic as possible and write clean code over hacky/smarty solution.
